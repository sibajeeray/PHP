Change the folder name event_name to your wish event name.

Use command present in query.sql file to create event_wish table in your DB(local/production)If it is not already presen there.

Always add .htaccess and robots.txt file in the event_name folder, These are helpful for the SEO and in .htaccess we have defined rules for
	redirection of the wish url to our wishApp.php and other security protocols are maintained in that.
